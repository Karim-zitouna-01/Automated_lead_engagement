   - Nearby region: 10
   - Non-match: 0

4. TECHNOLOGY (20%):
   - 3+ common technologies: 20
   - 1-2 technologies: 10
   - None: 0

5. PAIN POINTS/MOTIVATIONS (15%):
   - 3+ matches: 15

   - None: 0

6. MATURITY (15%):
   - Equal/higher level: 15
   - 1 level below: 8

Instructions:
1. Analyze each criterion separately
2. Apply weights
3. Return ONLY a valid JSON with:
   {
     "score": float,
     "justification": "one paragraph justifying the score using the 6 criteria"
   }

Format output **strictly** as JSON. No explanation before or after.
